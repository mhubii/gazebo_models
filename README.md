# Gazebo Models

This repository holds models for gazebo. Note that this repository is ment to be a submodule of [path_finding](https://github.com/mhubii/path_finding.git), and [nmpc_pattern_generator](https://github.com/mhubii/nmpc_pattern_generator). In order for some plugins to work properly, please clone these repositories recursively, or make sure to get your paths variable right on the build stage (see [Build](#build)).
